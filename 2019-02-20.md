# TfT 20 Feb 2019 - fourth meeting

## Summary email

Dear all,

We had an interesting meeting today. Before I rumble about the details, at the next meeting (12 March 2019, 1-2pm) Steve Price will give a presentation on the possiblity to run third-year educational research projects. These projects (45 ECTS) will be carried out in colloboration with the Institute of Education and could deal with exciting questions such as "Is there a mismatch between school and university teaching - is enzyme kinetics taught differently at school than at UCL?"

Coming back to the meeting, I will attempt to formulate "minutes" of our discussions henceforth. Notes can be found in the following GitHub repository (https://github.com/cistron/tea-for-teaching). This time we mainly dwelled on

1. post-graduate teaching assistants and
2. student maths skills

Unfortunately, we did not get to touch on references, which will happen in the next meeting.

### 1. PGTA motivation

Martina Wicklein has noted that PGTAs in labs are often not engaged. This might be because they are not motivated or not do not feel comfortable to engage with the students; the latter may be due to lack of skill. There also seems to be a shortage of PGTAs.

Martina also recounted her experience as a PGTA during her studies: Being a PGTA was a very coveted position and usually entailed teaching the same practicals for several years. Engagement with the students and demonstrations were frequent.

We brainstormed a couple of points on how to increase PGTA recruitment and fit.

1. PGTA database
	* Contains PGTA lab skills, which courses they taught on and how many hours
	* A form could be used for skills audit
	* Ideally this would be centrally managed and updated
2. Add required PGTA-skills to the module summary
	* This is relevant as the module database is currently being updated
3. Divisional PGTA training day
	* Instil the right culture; What is a good/bad PGTA?
	* In PhD induction week
	* Skills audit
4. Get feedback from PGTAs
	* What was good/bad about the teaching you did?
	* How could practicals be improved to make the more interesting to teach?
5. Particularly skilled PGTAs may be found on instrument booking lists

PGTAs can be paid for time spent on training and there no recommended amount of hours for this. If extensive training is required, ideally this would happen to junior PhD students who could teach on the course for several years.

### 2. Student numeracy skills

Martina also reported about struggles in NPP with student maths and essay writing skills (similar issues are observed in SMB). This is backed up by a survey with a high response-rate (75-80%), which asks students about extended writing, calculus, coding, whether they are native speakers and how much education in English they have had.

Interestingly, 80% of students have experience in calculus (or attend a first year Maths course), yet cannot apply their skills. On the language front, some have as little as 2 years of taught English experience. 

I find it disappointing that even a service Maths course does not improve the students numeracy skills. Maybe a future meeting can be dedicated to this issue and whether a dedicated biosciences maths/stats module is feasible (is there enough common ground between the departments) and how it could be structured.

Thanks all for coming. The next meeting will be on 12 March 2019, 13:00-14:00 in Darwin B15.

Best wishes,
Mike

## Notes

As taken during the discussion. Likely full of typos.

### PGTAs
* central database? On intranet
* More ownership
* Make it a coveted position
* Form with techniques for pgtas to fill in (skills audit)
* Module database, add skills needed for practicals
* Booking lists of instruments
* Recommended hours of training - not defined
* Divisional PGTA training day to instill the right culture - not just hang about passively in the lab (induction week for all PhD students)
* Slides/few points: What is a bad PGTA? What is a good PGTA?
* Query the PGTAs, what was good/bad? A bit like opinio survey for the practicals

### Subject level TEF pilot
* 24 subjects
* Bioscience, medical sciences
* Statements need to be backed up by impact evidence
* Tableau programme - takes excel spreadsheet to display data
* UCL has lots of data on students: e.g. average student 201 lecturecast recordings

### Third year educational research project
* 45 ECTS, 750 pounds funding
* With IoE. Supervised by two people - IoE lecturer and teaching fellow.
* 2-3 students do overlapping research to write a paper
* E.g. how is enzyme kinetics taught at school and how at UCL. Is there a mismatch?
* Link third to first years, interview how school transition happened (e.g. question above)

### Numercay issues
* NPP maths and essay writing struggles.
* high response rate survey (75-80%): 
	* Have you done extended writing, integration/differentiation, native speakers, multilingual, coding?
* 80 did calculus, can't apply
* as little as 2 years of English education
